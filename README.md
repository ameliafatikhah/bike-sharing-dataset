## About
This project aims is to make an analysis on bike sharing dataset and draw a conclusion on analysis process. This process invlove data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization with explanatory analysis. With this, data analysis concluded with expected result.

## Structure
- ```bike-sharing-dataset```: This directory contains both day and hour raw csv dataset and a readme txt file containing documentation of bike sharing dataset.
- ```dashboard```: This directory contains dashboard.py used for creating dashboards for present data analysis purposes and all_data.csv for combining both day and hour dataframe to one csv file.
- ```Amelia_Fatikhah_Proyek_Analisis_Data.ipynb```: This file is used to perform data analysis.
- ```README.md```: This is the documentation file.
- ```requirements.txt```: This file contains all the module that this project used.
- ```url.txt```: This file contain the streamlit dashboard url.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/ameliafatikhah/bike-sharing-dataset.git
```
2. Go to the project directory
```
cd bike-sharing-dataset
```
3. Install the required Python packages by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Process
1. **Data Wrangling**: includes Gathering data, Assessing Data, and Cleaning Data and all code is available on ```Amelia_Fatikhah_Proyek_Analisis_Data.ipynb```.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: includes explore and visualization & eplanatory analysis and all code is also available on ```Amelia_Fatikhah_Proyek_Analisis_Data.ipynb```.
3.  **Data Visualization**: through streamlit, dashboard for this bike sharing analysis is available with the usual command of:
```
cd Amelia_Fatikhah_Proyek_Analisis_Data.ipynb/dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
